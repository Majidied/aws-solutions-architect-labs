### **Project 2: Serverless Image Processing Pipeline with S3, SQS & Lambda**

**Architecture:** Serverless 

**Description:** Build a serverless image processing pipeline where uploads to an S3 source bucket publish events to an SQS queue. A Lambda function polls the queue, resizes and watermarks images, then stores results in a destination S3 bucket. Step Functions orchestrate multi-step workflows (e.g., thumbnail \+ full-res \+ metadata extraction). CloudFront serves the processed images globally.

**Key AWS Services:**

* **Step Functions:** Standard workflow — validate → resize → watermark → store  
* **API Gateway:** Pre-signed URL generation endpoint for uploads  
* **DynamoDB:** Image metadata store (upload time, dimensions, status)  
* **CloudFront:** Serve processed images with low latency globally  
* **SNS:** Notify on job completion or failure

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Design event-driven architectures using S3 event notifications and SQS  
* Understand why SQS decoupling improves resilience and enables retries  
* Use Lambda Layers to package large dependencies (image libraries)  
* Orchestrate multi-step serverless workflows with Step Functions  
* Apply S3 lifecycle policies to transition or expire objects by storage class  
* Serve processed content through CloudFront with appropriate cache behaviors

### **Project 5: Multi-Region Disaster Recovery with Route 53 Failover**

**Architecture:** Hybrid / DR

**Description:** Implement a multi-region disaster recovery strategy for a web application. The primary region (us-east-1) runs the full stack. The secondary region (eu-west-1) maintains warm standby resources. Route 53 health checks detect primary region failure and automatically fail over DNS.

* **S3 Cross-Region Replication:** Replicate user data and static assets to secondary region  
* **DynamoDB Global Tables:** Multi-region active-active replication for low-latency reads  
* **EC2 \+ ASG (both regions):** Warm standby — minimal instances, scale up on failover trigger  
* **CloudFormation StackSets:** Deploy identical infrastructure across regions consistently

**Key AWS Services:**

* **ECS Fargate:** Task definitions, services, capacity providers; no server management  
* **ECR:** Private container registry with image vulnerability scanning on push  
* **ALB \+ Target Groups:** Route traffic to multiple ECS services by path (e.g. /api/orders)
